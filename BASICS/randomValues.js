/*
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.
JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive).
 Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1

Note
Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, 
so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.

function randomFraction() {

  
  
    return Math.random()

  }

  console.log(randomFraction())
