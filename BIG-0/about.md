## There are lots of different solutions and implementations to solutions.

## In an example where we have multiple implementations of the same function, we may want to determine which implementation is the best.

## This is where Big-O comes in.  Its a  way of analysing code, talking about it and comparing it's performance to other pieces of code .

## We can assign labels to our different implementations, instead of saying "Excellent", "Average" ,"i guess",  "Appalling"
